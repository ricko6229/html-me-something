                    As I sit wondering of what to type about, a gust of momentum seems to hit me like a fly in the way of a trian. Each passing letter on the keyboard seems to be 
                    pressed with greater ease than the one before it. It seems that nothing will stop me now. The relativity of time seems to morph into something that didn't 
                    exist before I started typing this page. The speed and accuarcy of every keystroke seems as swift as if it was given by Hermes himself, then it happens...

                    The phone rings as feriously as a lion alone in the jungle. The sound is enough to catch my attention, but not to distract me from the work that lays ahead. 
                    The mighty lion roars time and time again intill its roars are finally vanquished. The bliss of silence that followed allowed me to return to my work. 
                    However, I then heard it... a voicemail sounding as if a coin was dropped. That curiosity of that singular sound got me out of my seat and before I knew it...

                    I was lost in a mist of distractions. All by which were brought upon by this singular device that had grasped my attention with a single swipe. The amount of  
                    content that was in my fingertips filled everygit  corner of my imagination. I could just sit back and watch a lifetime of work with a single swipe of a finger. 
                    The possiblites seemed endesly and to the power of the device I had fallen. I sat there lost in the mist I kept trying to escape. The fight seemed to have no 
                    end. When I tried to fight it, it would just come destroying the wall that I had built around it to keep me out. The fight seemed to have no end. The battle   
                    of the ages had begun, and it seemed that I was closer and closer to the end. Intill the battery died. With that last swipe of my sword, the enemy had been 
                    defeated, and I could focus on the bigger battle that lay ahead..... Assignment #4

                    I knew now with confidence that no obstacle would stand in my way. There was no way that I would loose this fight this time. Assigment #4 was in to finally 
                    meet its match. With confidence in every keystroke I knew that this was the start of the end. Then I heard it... a sound that started soft and light. There 
                    quickness in its movement, and there was power in every step. Everthing stayed still as the steps became louder. The sound was no longer soft and swift, but 
                    loud and thundurous. A foe like this was one I had never heard the sound of. As I turned around the door slowly opened and then I saw a foe that I knew would 
                    take all my effort. One that would drive me away from my work and all that lay infront of me.......
